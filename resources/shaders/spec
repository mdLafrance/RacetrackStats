Spec for shaders:

0 MVP : 4x4 matrix
1 map_Kd : map of diffuse
2 map_Ks : map of Spec
3 norm : normal map

Spec for lights:

Lights will be given in a 3x3 matrix:

[c0 p0 a]
[c1 p1 b]
[c2 p2 c]

With:
    c<x> = color component x
    p<x> = position component x

    a -> directonal or point?
        a = 0 -> directional light
        a != 0 -> point light
