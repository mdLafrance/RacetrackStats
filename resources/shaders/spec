Spec for lights:

Lights will be given in a 3x3 matrix:

[c0 p0 dp]
[c1 p1 i]
[c2 p2 _]

With:
    c<x> = color component x
    p<x> = position component x

    dp -> directonal or point?
        dp = 0 -> directional light
        dp != 0 -> point light

    i -> intensity of light

Texture position values:
TEXTURE_LOCATION_map_Kd 0
TEXTURE_LOCATION_map_Ka 1
TEXTURE_LOCATION_map_Ks 2
TEXTURE_LOCATION_norm 3

Shader and material flags:
MATERIAL_USE_map_Kd   1
MATERIAL_USE_map_Ks   2
MATERIAL_USE_map_norm 4
MATERIAL_USE_Ka       8
MATERIAL_USE_Kd       16
MATERIAL_USE_Ks       32
MATERIAL_USE_Ns       64
MATERIAL_USE_Tr       128

Improvements:
-OBJs each create a vertex data array which is thrown away after buffering, only 1 is needed for all objects
-Parrellize loading of files
