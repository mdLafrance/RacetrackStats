.scene files
=========================================================
Scene files define the objects, textures, and lights for a scene. Each line in the file defines some facet of the scene (described below)
Lines can start with '#', and will be ignored.

<name> : indicates the name of the scene
ex. "name Mosport Low Resolution Scene"

<mesh> : Indicates some mesh file to be loaded into the scene.
ex. "mesh mosport_trees.obj"

<material> : Indicates a mtl library to be loaded for some matching mesh.
ex. "material mosport_trees.mtl"

<ambient> : Defines ambient light to be used in the scene, followed by rgb values for the ambient light (between 0-1)
ex. "ambient 0.2 0.2 0.2"

<light> : Defines a light to be used in the scene (can be more than one). Followed immediately by either 'directional' or 'point' (only directional is implemented atm).
-i defines the intensity (any floating point value)
-v defines the direction vector of the light
-c defines the rgb color of the light (between 0 and 1)
ex. light directional -i 2.5 -v -2 -10 -5 -c 0.65 0.6 0.6

Example .scene file:

# Low res mosport track for smaller machines
name Mosport (Low)

# Meshes
mesh jr_mosport.obj
mesh mosport_horizon.obj
mesh mosport_vehicles.obj
mesh mosport_objects.obj
mesh mosport_layers.obj
mesh mosport_trees.obj

# Materials
material mtl_low/jr_mosport.mtl
material mtl_low/mosport_horizon.mtl
material mtl_low/mosport_vehicles.mtl
material mtl_low/mosport_objects.mtl
material -t mtl_low/mosport_layers.mtl
material -t mtl_low/mosport_trees.mtl

# Scene ambient light (r g b)
ambient 0.43 0.43 0.4

# Lights for the scene
light directional -i 2.5 -v -2 -10 -5 -c 0.65 0.6 0.6 

=========================================================
config files
=========================================================
The application will attempt to load a file called config.txt at launch, which defines which data from the CSV the app will use to draw vectors and graphs
Lines can start with '#', and will be ignored.

<longitude> : which CSV data defines the longitude of the car
ex. "longitude GPS_Longitude"

<latitude> : which CSV data defines the latitude of the car
ex. "latitude GPS_Latitude"

<elevation> : which CSV data defines the elevation of the car
ex. "elevation GPS_Elevation"

<heading> : which CSV data defines the heading of the car
ex. "heading GPS_Heading"

<vector> : Define a vector to be drawn who's length is determined by CSV data, followed by origin vector, direction vector, color rgb, CSV data type
ex. "vector 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0.8 0.8 0.2 INLINE_ACC"

<graph> : Define type to be drawn to a graph, followed by the CSV data type, then color of the line r g b, and optional integer identifying which graph the data should be displayed on
ex. "graph BRAKE_PRESS 1.0 0.2 0.2"
